# REST Test Website

This repository contains an example which uses PayPal's REST API.

## Prerequisites

   * PHP 5.3 or above
   * curl, json & openssl extensions must be enabled
   * composer for fetching dependencies (See http://getcomposer.org)

## Running the sample

   * Download all the files and copy them on your local server
   * Sample has dependency on the sdk and you can use `Composer` to get the dependencies. Ensure that you have composer installed on your machine, navigate to the samples folder and run 'composer update --no-dev' to fetch the SDK.
   * In case you cannot install composer on your machine, you can also fetch the SDK bundle from https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/raw/gh-pages/rest-api-sdk/php/rest-api-sdk-php-0.7.1.zip and unzip the bundle in to the folder.
   * Optionally, update the bootstrap.php file with your own client Id and client secret.
